abstract: Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) is a debilitating neuropsychological syndrome that often follows brain injury, in particular a stroke affecting the right hemisphere. In current clinical practice, the assessment of neglect is based on old-fashioned paper-and-pencil and behavioral tasks, and sometimes relies on the examiner’s subjective judgment. Therefore, there is a need for more exhaustive, objective and ecological assessments of USN. In this paper, we present two tasks in immersive virtual reality to assess peripersonal and extrapersonal USN. The tasks are designed with several levels of difficulty to increase sensitivity of the assessment. We then validate the feasibility of both assessments in a group of healthy adult participants. We report data from a study with a group of neurologically unimpaired participants (N = 39). The results yield positive feedback on comfort, usability and design of the tasks. We propose new objective scores based on participant’s performance captured by head gaze and hand position information, including, for instance, time of exploration, moving time towards left/right and time-to-reach, which could be used for the evaluation of the attentional spatial bias with neurological patients. Together with the number of omissions, the new proposed parameters can result in lateralized index ratios as a measure of asymmetry in space exploration. We presented two innovative assessments for USN based on immersive virtual reality, evaluating the far and the near space, using ecological tasks in multimodal, realistic environments. The proposed protocols and objective scores can help distinguish neurological patients with and without USN.
