abstract: Altitudinal neglect is an atypical form of spatial neglect where brain-damaged patients neglect the lower, or sometimes the upper, part of the space. Our understanding of this phenomena is limited, with unknown occurrence across different reference frames, such as distance (peripersonal vs. extrapersonal) and system of reference (egocentric vs. allocentric). Two patients with acute bilateral (P1) or right hemispheric (P2) stroke, with signs of bottom altitudinal neglect, underwent an extensive evaluation of neglect within 10 days post-stroke. Assessments involved altitudinal neglect and unilateral spatial neglect (USN) in peripersonal space, exploring egocentric and allocentric signs and in extrapersonal space. Compared to a control group of 15 healthy age-matched subjects, patients showed allocentric and egocentric left USN in peripersonal space, and mostly allocentric signs of altitudinal neglect. No signs of neglect were evidenced in extrapersonal space. Altitudinal neglect could thus present as an allocentric form of spatial neglect, suggesting that allocentric representations may not only affect the deployment of attentional resources along horizontal dimensions but also operate along vertical dimensions. Future studies should deepen our understanding of altitudinal neglect, eventually leading to further unravel spatial processes that control attention, their corresponding brain mechanisms, and implications for patients’ rehabilitation and functional outcome.
