I  am a clinical neuropsychologist and a neuroscience researcher at the University Hospital of Geneva and the Campus Biotech. My main research interest lies in the study of cognitive deficits following right-brain damage. In particular, I focused on different characteristics of unilateral spatial neglect following right brain damage, including productive symptoms, and new assessment and rehabilitative tools to better evaluate and restore neuropsychological symptoms.

I am currently carrying out a project to better understand and treat the presence of unawareness for neurological illness (anosognosia) in patients with and without unilateral spatial neglect, combining behavioural, lesional and electrophysiological measures. Finally, I am also investigating different bodily disorders, such as personal neglect and somatoparaphrenia.
