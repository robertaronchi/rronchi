I  am a clinical neuropsychologist and a neuroscience researcher at the University Hospital of Geneva and the Campus Biotech. My main research interest lies in the study of cognitive deficits following right-brain damage. In particular, I focused on different characteristics of unilateral spatial neglect following right brain damage, including productive symptoms, and new assessment and rehabilitative tools to better evaluate and restore neuropsychological symptoms.

I am currently carrying out a series of projects to unveil the functional and neural mechanisms of self-awareness in neurological patients after stroke. One line of research is focused on the presence of unawareness for neurological illness (anosognosia) in patients with and without unilateral spatial neglect. Moreover, I am leading few projects on bodily awareness, specifically the covert manifestations of somatoparaphrenia and disownership of body parts. In my research, I am combining behavioural, lesional and electrophysiological measures, for a better understanding and possible treatment of disabling cognitive deficits after acquired brain lesions.
